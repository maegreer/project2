    <p>you aproach the statue. it is a large marble angel watching over the grave below.
    you stoop to read the inscription. it reads "here lies richie friend of none."
    the inscription seems odd and as you examine it you see a face that isn't yours.
    it comes out of the toumbstone and screams. you run out of the cemetery.</p>
