For this game, I wanted to focus on the monotany of quarantine. Poeple had to make an effort to get out of the house so this game tells the story of a dailey walk. The game also has some dissociative properties because everyday is almost the same despite one's choices. The game plays as if it is happening to the player. They can make choices but the choices still lead to the same conclusion-going back inside and getting back to work.
